NOTE:
-----
By default the congatec board controller UARTs may only be used while running with administrator privileges under Windows10.
In order to be able to use the congatec board controller UARTs with user privileges as well, a registry adaption is required.
For this, please run CgbcSerAllowEveryone.bat with adminstrator privileges after the installation of the CgbcSer driver.
Afterwards access to the congatec board controller UARTs via CgbcSer will permanently be allowed with user privileges as well.
